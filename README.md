# PCA-To-Investigate-Sensory-Attributes-in-Cocoa-Bean-Liquor 

This project investigates the sensory attributes of cocoa bean liquor using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Preference Mapping**. The research aims to explore how different sensory attributes contribute to variations in cocoa bean samples and how these attributes influence consumer preferences.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: Sensory profiling and consumer liking data for cocoa bean liquor samples from 10 different farms. The dataset includes 15 sensory attributes like floral, bitter, fruity, and woody.
- **Objective**: To identify the relationships between sensory attributes and consumer preferences and determine the predominant attributes that affect consumer liking.
- **Methods**:
  - **PCA**: Used to reduce the dimensionality of the sensory profiling data and visualize the relationships between the samples.
  - **Preference Mapping**: Applied to relate consumer preferences to specific sensory attributes, providing insights into which attributes drive consumer liking.

## Key Findings

- **PCA** revealed significant variation in sensory profiles, with attributes like *woody* and *bitter* having the strongest influence.
- **Preference Mapping** indicated that certain consumers preferred attributes such as *herbal* and *hearthy-mouldy*, while *smoky* and *fruity* were less favored by the majority.

## Visualizations

- **Score plots** and **loading plots** were used to explore sensory attribute variation and consumer preference trends.
- **Box plots** and **histograms** were generated for a detailed analysis of consumer ratings.
